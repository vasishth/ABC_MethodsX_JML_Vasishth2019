	abstract = {A central question in online human sentence comprehension is: how are linguistic
	relations established between different parts of a sentence? Previous work has shown that
	this dependency resolution process can be computationally expensive, but the underlying
	reasons for this are still unclear. We argue that dependency resolution is mediated by
	cue-based retrieval, constrained by independently motivated working memory principles
	defined in a cognitive architecture (ACT-R). To demonstrate this, we investigate an
	unusual instance of dependency resolution, the processing of negative and positive
	polarity items, and confirm a surprising prediction of the cue-based retrieval model:
	partial cue-matches, which constitute a kind of similarity-based interference, can give
	rise to the intrusion of ungrammatical retrieval candidates, leading to both processing
	slow-downs and even errors of judgment that take the form of illusions of grammaticality
	in patently ungrammatical structures. A notable achievement is that good quantitative
	fits are achieved without adjusting the key model parameters.},
